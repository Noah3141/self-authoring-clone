# A Clone of the Self Authoring Program

### Todo:

1. When finished typing on title inputs, a green check shows that the value has been saved. This should persist, but goes away on refocus of the input. (is this a bug?)

1. The experiences for an epoch page initializes with like 8 experiences. What should happen if they neglect to delete and neglect to fill out some of the bottom ones? What about if they are insane and skip one for no reason?
