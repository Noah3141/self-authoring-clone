                        Take a moment to consider your home and family life.
                        Peaceful, harmonious family life provides people with a
                        sense of belonging, support for their ambitions, and
                        reciprocal purpose. Describe what your ideal family
                        would be like. You can write about your parents and
                        siblings, or about your plans for your own partner, or
                        about your children, if any â€“ or about all of these.
                        What kind of partner would be good for you? How could
                        you improve your relationship with your parents or
                        siblings?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Think and write for at least two minutes, then move on.
